1. What is an array?
	a, A data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type
	b, A type of loop used in programming
	c, A programming language
	d, A network of computers


2. What is the index of the first element in an array?
	a, 0
	b, 1
	c, -1
	d, It depends on the programming language


3. What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array?
	a, O(1)
	b, O(n)
	c, O(log n)
	d, O(n^2)


16. What is a binary tree?
	a, A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children
	b, A type of loop used in programming
	c, Both a and b
	d, None of the above


17. What is the height of a tree?
	a, The maximum number of edges in a path from the root to a leaf node
	b, The minimum number of edges in a path from the root to a leaf node
	c, The total number of nodes in the tree
	d, The total number of edges in the tree


18. What is a binary search tree?
	a, A binary tree in which the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
	b, A binary tree in which every node has at most two children
	c, A binary tree in which every level is completely filled
	d, A binary tree in which every leaf node is at the same level
